## 1: Image Quality Metrics

A couple of functions are deined that can be used to calculate the PSNR, MSE, and SSIM. 
The structural similiarity (SSIM) index was imported directly from the scikit-image library.
However, we will have to define our own functions for the PSNR and MSE. 
Furthermore, we will wrap all three of these metrics into a single function that we can call later.
